# Better Alternate Recipes 
---
### General Info:
A mod that makes recipes way more efficient. Every recipe works like this: throw in 1 of each ingredient, wait 10 seconds, and get 10x the product! It even lets you automate stuff you couldn't before, like Mycelia, Food, and Power Shards. With these new alternate recipes, you can crank out items at up to 150 parts per minute, making your factory run smoother than ever. All of this was inspired by this mod [Alternate Recipes](https://ficsit.app/mod/AlternateRecipes) (Doesn't include any of its assets), hopefully they will update soon but I plan to do more with this mod than that one did!

### FAQ:
##### Will it be kept up to date?
 I will try my best to keep this mod up to date once it is fully completed, if by any chance the game gets new items or this mod fails to function I will likely be on top of it before you can tell!

##### Is it compatible with other mods?
Generally, yes. This mod should work alongside most others, but I haven't tested all the mods in the world so don't take my word for it.

##### Is it compatible with multiplayer?
It should be after testing with a local server but again don't take my word for it as I am primarily new to this and if any problems arise please report them on the [Github Page](https://github.com/TheFarawayDev/Satisfactory-Mods/issues/new?assignees=TheFarawayDev&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

### Planned Features:
- New Machines (Power, Production, Storage)
- Stuff recommended by you!

### Additional Information:
- Please ask before using the code for this mod or any assets inside/used by it!
